# E-Commerce-Data-Preparation-Insights
Data preparation on real-world Brazilian ecommerce public dataset  made for category-level Masrket Basket Analysis

## Repository Structure
- `data_preparation.ipynb` — main Python file
- `data/raw/` — original CSVs (unmodified)
- `data/processed/` — final table for Tableau
- `MBA_Olist.twbx` — Tableau packaged workbook

## Data
Source: [Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data)

Orders made at [Olist store](https://www.olist.com/) (Brazil) in 2016 to 2018. Collection methodology: Random Sampling.

## Key Metrics 

## Possible Next Steps
- Aggregate categories into broader groups to increase support.
- Olist full product-level MBA (instead of category-level) — more pairs, but will be still sparse.
- Investigate data collection bias — it’s possible the dataset reflects a preference for single-product or single-category orders (e.g., promotional setup, platform-specific ordering habits).
